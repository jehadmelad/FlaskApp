## Run the application.

It is a good habit to run the application within python virtual environment. By following the next structure you will be able to do so.


install python virtual environment 'virtualenv' using pip:
```
pip3 install virtualenv 
```

Go to the folder that you would like to work in (In this case: /FlaskApp), then create an virtual environment by:
```
virtualenv <name-you-would-like>
```

Now, try to install the required packeage for this application.
```
c:/users/hp/documents/folder/FlaskApp/:~ pip3 install -r requiremnets.txt
```

Finally, open your browser and write the `localhost:5001` or your `ip addres:5001`.
